                            After my graduation, I can see myself having my own small <br>business which is fixing, cleaning computers, and updating<br> operation systems.
                            I will find a job that suits the degree that I<br> took. Finding a job will be hard so for the meantime I will try to <br> do acoustic live sessions
                            in caf√©s or perform with a band inside <br> a bar to earn a bit of money and also enjoy doing the things <br> that I love which is playing music and 
                            performing to the public.
