                            My strengths in the field of Information Technology <br> highlights when it comes to hardware related problems.<br>
                            Growing up being exposed to computer made me explore <br>
                             the parts inside it. It led to helping me troubleshoot my own <br> computer when it comes to hardware problems and clean <br> 
                            it on my own. I can teach my own and not hesitate trying new<br>things when it comes to exploring things related to computer <br> hardware. <br><br>

                            Weakness <br> <br>
                            My weakness in the field of Information Technology is exposed <br> when it comes to programming. I am having a hard time when <br>
                            it comes to software and programming related things. I need <br> to search codes to be familiarized with their functions even <br> 
                            though I have encountered them before. I am looking forward <br> to learning a lot when it comes to programming so that I can <br>
                            overcome this weakness of mine.
